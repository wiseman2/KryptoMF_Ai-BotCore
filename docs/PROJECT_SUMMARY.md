# KryptoMF_Ai Bot Core - Project Summary

## 📋 Overview

**KryptoMF_Ai Bot Core** is a fully functional, open-source cryptocurrency trading bot engine that runs from the command line. It's the core component of the KryptoMF_Ai ecosystem, providing all the essential trading functionality.

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Fully Functional Free Version** - Complete trading bot that works without any paid components
2. **Open Source & Auditable** - All security-critical code is open for community review
3. **Advanced Trading Strategies** - Indicator-based strategies, not just time-based automation
4. **Exchange-Native Features** - Leverage exchange capabilities (trailing orders, etc.) when available
5. **Plugin Architecture** - Easy to extend with custom strategies, exchanges, and indicators
6. **Community-Driven** - Enable community contributions for exchanges, strategies, and indicators

### Business Model Context

This is the **open-source core** of a dual-licensing model:

- **Open Source Core (Free)** - This repository - Fully functional CLI bot
- **Premium Trading Bot Application (Paid)** - Separate repository - Multi-bot management with visual interface

The open-source core is intentionally feature-complete to provide real value to the community while the premium Trading Bot Application adds convenience features for non-technical users.

## ✨ Key Features

### Advanced Trading Strategies

#### 1. Advanced DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)
Based on the original KryptoMFG multibot implementation, this strategy applies profit from subsequent sales to reduce the cost basis of previous purchases.

**How it works:**
- Buy #1: 1 BTC @ $50,000 (cost: $50,000) - First purchase, no DCA applied
- Buy #2: 1 BTC @ $48,000 (cost: $48,000)
- Sell #2: 1 BTC @ $49,000 (profit: $1,000)
- After min profit threshold (1% = $480), remaining profit ($520) is applied to Buy #1
- Buy #1 new cost: $49,480 (reduced from $50,000)
- Buy #1 fees recalculated based on new cost
- Buy #1 new sell price: Recalculated with new cost + fees + profit target
- If Buy #1 has a trailing sell order, it's automatically cancelled and replaced with new price

This makes earlier purchases easier to sell at profit and allows for continuous accumulation.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Fee-Aware**: Uses configured maker/taker fee percentages for accurate calculations
- ✅ **First Purchase Exception**: Purchase #1 never applies DCA (no previous purchase)
- ✅ **Trailing Order Management**: Cancels and replaces trailing orders when DCA is applied
- ✅ **Double-Counting Prevention**: Subtracts previously applied DCA from profit stats
- ✅ **Progressive Step-Down**: Requires progressively lower prices to prevent clustering

**Configuration:**
- `min_profit_percent`: Minimum profit before applying DCA (default: 0.5%, or uses `profit_target` from root config)
- `dca_pool_percent`: Percentage of excess profit to apply (default: 100%)
- `max_purchases`: Maximum number of active purchases (default: -1 for unlimited)
- `step_down_multiplier`: Multiplier for progressive step-down (default: 1.5)
- `max_step_down`: Maximum step-down percentage (default: 5.0%)

#### 2. Enhanced DCA with Indicators
Instead of time-based buying, this strategy uses technical indicators to identify optimal entry points.

**Features:**
- **Price Drop Requirement**: Must see a price drop before considering a buy
- **Indicator Validation**: Uses RSI, Stochastic RSI, EMA, MACD, MFI
- **Majority Voting**: Requires at least 50% of enabled indicators to agree
- **Configurable**: Select which indicators to use and adjust thresholds

**No more blind buying** - The bot waits for favorable market conditions based on your selected indicators.

#### 3. Grid Trading with Indicator Validation
Traditional grid trading places buy/sell orders at fixed intervals. This enhanced version validates orders with technical indicators before placement.

**Features:**
- **Smart Grid Placement**: Grid orders validated with indicators
- **Prevents Blind Buying**: Won't place buy orders in unfavorable conditions
- **Configurable Validation**: Enable/disable indicator checks for buys and sells separately
- **Indicator Support**: RSI, MACD, EMA validation

#### 4. Exchange-Native Trailing Orders
For exchanges that support it (Binance/Binance.US), trailing orders are placed directly on the exchange.

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Orders persist through power outages
- ✅ Orders persist through internet issues
- ✅ Orders persist through computer crashes
- ✅ More reliable than bot-managed trailing

**Supported Exchanges:**
- Binance
- Binance.US
- Binance USD-M Futures
- Binance COIN-M Futures

**Best Practice:** Always place trailing sell orders immediately after buy orders complete to protect your position.

### Technical Indicators Module

Reusable technical analysis indicators for all strategies:

- **RSI** (Relative Strength Index) - Oversold/overbought detection
- **Stochastic RSI** - More sensitive momentum indicator
- **EMA** (Exponential Moving Average) - Trend detection
- **MACD** (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) - Trend and momentum
- **MFI** (Money Flow Index) - Volume-weighted momentum
- **Price Drop Detection** - Percentage drop over lookback period
- **Price Rising Detection** - Recent price momentum

**Library:** Uses `ta` (Technical Analysis library) for reliable, well-tested implementations.

### Security Features

All security-critical code is open source for community audit:

1. **API Key Storage**
   - OS-native keychain integration (macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI, Linux Secret Service)
   - Encrypted fallback storage
   - Keys NEVER transmitted to any server
   - Local-only access

2. **Order Signing**
   - HMAC/EdDSA/ECDSA signing
   - Timestamp/nonce for replay protection
   - Signature validation
   - No secrets logged

3. **Secrets Handling**
   - Automatic redaction in logs
   - Secure I/O boundaries
   - Memory clearing after use

### Plugin System

Easy to extend with custom functionality:

- **Exchange Plugins** - Add support for new exchanges
- **Strategy Plugins** - Create custom trading strategies
- **Indicator Plugins** - Add new technical indicators
- **Signal Plugins** - Integrate external signals (webhooks, TradingView, etc.)

3. **Configuration-Driven**
   - YAML/JSON configuration files
   - Interactive CLI prompts (if no config)
   - Sensible defaults

4. **Plugin-Based**
   - Easy to add new exchanges
   - Easy to add new strategies
